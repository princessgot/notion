And if you think of them as dirty, then they will be dirty—they will be dirty because you will be giving nothing, you will be despising your flesh and his.

      "Reflect on the world that you carry within yourself. And name this thinking what you wish.... Your innermost happening is worth all your love.",

      "What you really need is simply this — aloneness, great inner solitude. To go within and for hours not to meet anyone — that is what one needs to attain. To be lonely as one was lonely as a child, while adults were moving about, entangled with things that seemed big and important, because the grownups looked so busy and because one could not understand any of their doings — that must be the goal. And when you realize one day that their activities are superficial, that their careers are paralyzed and no longer linked with life, then why not look at the world as a child would see it — out of the depths of your own world, out of the breadth of your own aloneness, which is itself work and rank and career?

      "If there seems to be no communication between you and the people around you, try to draw close to those things that will not ever leave you. The nights are still there and the winds that roam through the trees and over many lands. Amidst things and among animals are happenings in which you can participate. The children too, are still the same as you were as a child, sad and happy in the same way. And if you think about your childhood, then you can again live among them, the lonely children — where the adults count for nothing and their dignity has no worth.",

      "Don’t you see that everything that happens becomes a beginning again and again?",

      "To love is also good, for love is difficult. For one human being to love another is perhaps the most difficult task of all, the epitome, the ultimate test. It is that striving for which all other striving is merely preparation.",

      "The quieter and more patient, the more open we are when we are sad, the more resolutely does that something new enter into us, the deeper it is absorbed in us, the more certain we are to secure it, and the more certain it is to become our personal destiny.",

      "Surely it is possible that we shall gradually learn to recognize that what we call fate emerges from human beings, it does not enter into them from the outside.",

      "Only he who can expect anything, who does not exclude even the mysterious, will have a relationship to life greater than just being alive, he will exhaust his own wellspring of being.",

      "I was born as sweet as that and if I am too sweet for your tastes then just clamp your mouth shut and spin on your heels. I can’t add sourness to my sap anymore just to fit onto a menu in a restaurant for wimps.",

      "To have to kill even one of my hearts to match up with you is simply not worth it to me, after all that has happened.",

      "I said who I was, on my land.",

      "You are happy for yourself that you have received the honor of a new day on which to ride.",

      "So, my little Amelié…your bones aren’t made of glass. You can take life’s knocks.",

      "Our waking life is sometimes like a dream, which proceeds logically enough until the stimulus of some new sensation, from without or within, throws it into temporary confusion, or suspends its action; after which it goes on again, but with fresh characters, passions, and motives, and a changed argument. - William Henry Hudson.",

      "To be alive: not just the carcass / But the spark.",

      "Don’t bend; don’t water it down; don’t try to make it logical; don’t edit your own soul according to the fashion. Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly. - Anne Rice",

      "Don’t lament so much about how your career is going turn out. You don’t have a career. You have a life. Keep the faith. Do the work…The useless days will add up to something. The shitty waitressing jobs. The writing in your journal. The long meandering walks. The hours reading poetry and novels and dead people’s diaries and wondering about sex and God and whether you should shave under your arms or not. These things are your becoming. — Cheryl Strayed",

      "I am going to outlive myself. Eat, sleep, sleep, eat. Exist slowly, softly, like these trees, like a puddle of water, like the red bench in the streetcar. — Jean-Paul Sartre, Nausea",

      "“Don’t wait for it,” I said. “Create a world, your world. Alone. Stand alone. Create. And then the love will come to you, then it comes to you. It was only when I wrote my first book that the world I wanted to live in opened to me.” — Anaïs Nin",

      "what if this is paradise and we don’t have to wait for anything else? - Unknown"

      "Freakery is that piece of disability and ableism where bodies that are deformed, disfigured, scarred and non-normatively physically disabled live…It is how I know we must never let ourselves be on the side of the gawking crowd ever again in any way."

      "This is our work as femmes of color: to take the notion of beauty (and most importantly the value placed upon it) and dismantle it (challenge it), not just in gender, but wherever it is being used to harm people, to exclude people, to shame people; as a justification for violence, colonization and genocide."

      "If white people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, it doesn’t matter. We know we are beautiful. And ugly too."
