And if you think of them as dirty, then they will be dirty—they will be dirty because you will be giving nothing, you will be despising your flesh and his.

      "Reflect on the world that you carry within yourself. And name this thinking what you wish.... Your innermost happening is worth all your love.",

      "What you really need is simply this — aloneness, great inner solitude. To go within and for hours not to meet anyone — that is what one needs to attain. To be lonely as one was lonely as a child, while adults were moving about, entangled with things that seemed big and important, because the grownups looked so busy and because one could not understand any of their doings — that must be the goal. And when you realize one day that their activities are superficial, that their careers are paralyzed and no longer linked with life, then why not look at the world as a child would see it — out of the depths of your own world, out of the breadth of your own aloneness, which is itself work and rank and career?

      "If there seems to be no communication between you and the people around you, try to draw close to those things that will not ever leave you. The nights are still there and the winds that roam through the trees and over many lands. Amidst things and among animals are happenings in which you can participate. The children too, are still the same as you were as a child, sad and happy in the same way. And if you think about your childhood, then you can again live among them, the lonely children — where the adults count for nothing and their dignity has no worth.",

      "Don’t you see that everything that happens becomes a beginning again and again?",

      "To love is also good, for love is difficult. For one human being to love another is perhaps the most difficult task of all, the epitome, the ultimate test. It is that striving for which all other striving is merely preparation.",

      "The quieter and more patient, the more open we are when we are sad, the more resolutely does that something new enter into us, the deeper it is absorbed in us, the more certain we are to secure it, and the more certain it is to become our personal destiny.",

      "Surely it is possible that we shall gradually learn to recognize that what we call fate emerges from human beings, it does not enter into them from the outside.",

      "Only he who can expect anything, who does not exclude even the mysterious, will have a relationship to life greater than just being alive, he will exhaust his own wellspring of being.",
